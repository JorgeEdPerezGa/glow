# GLOW

GLOW is a mobile application that provides a user's clinician the ability to accurately measure and record anxiety and depression related disorders', based on an individuals state in the PHQ-9 scale. The PHQ-9, created by Dr. Kurt Kroenke, is a validated, 9-question tool to assess for the degree of depression present in an individual; the questions help the clinician assess the impact of the patient's symptoms on his or her life. In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.

GLOW allows for an accurate measure of day to day anxiety and depression progress. Different colors are representative of the user's weekly state; allowing for a user's acknowledgment of such state.
